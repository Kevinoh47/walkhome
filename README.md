# Walkhome
**Author**: walkhome app by Kevin, Jamilah, James, Mike and Harry<br/>
**Version**: 1.0.4<br/> 

## Overview
As a user, I would like an app that is visually pleasing and with a simple input to find the walk score of a location with and address that I provide. I want the app to be expandable to partner with real estate companies, rental agencies, local restaurants and night-life. These partnerships could create a revenue source for the application.
