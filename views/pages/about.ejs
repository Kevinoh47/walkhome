             <h2>James Denton</h2>
             <p>I grew up in Rocky Mount NC. After Highschool, I spent a year in college, decided it wasn't for me and joined the Army. While in the Army I went to many nice and interesting places Fort Polk, LA; Iraq; South Korea; Fort Lewis, WA; Afghanistan; Fort Leonard Wood, MO. After I got out of the Army I went to Lincoln, NE for a year until I found my current job. I am married with one daughter; I met my wife while stationed in Korea; I always joke that I loved the culture so much that I had to bring a piece back with me. Although it has been hard for us sometimes; she has stuck by my side through multiple deployments to Afghanistan and is always our familyâ€™s rock, and for that I will always love her.</p>
